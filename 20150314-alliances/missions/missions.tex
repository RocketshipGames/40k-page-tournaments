\missionheading{Army Construction}

Players will register and compete in teams of two.  Army construction
rules are an adaptation of the 2015 Adepticon Team Tournament rules,
as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item Each player fields a base detachment of 1000 points chosen from
  a single faction, adhering to the following force organization:

\bigskip
  \centerline{\begin{tabular}{cl}
    1 & HQ\\
    0--1 & Elites\\
    1--3 & Troops\\
    0--1 & Fast Attack\\
    0--1 & Heavy Support\\
  \end{tabular}}

\item Each player may additionally take a single upgrade from the
  following list.  Both players in a team may not take the same
  upgrade.

  \begin{squishitemize}
  \item Base Detachment Upgrades
    \begin{squishitemize}      
    \item +1 Elite 
    \item +1 Fast Attack
    \item +1 Heavy Support
    \item +1 Fortification
    \item +1 Lord of War
    \end{squishitemize}

  \item Army Upgrades
    \begin{squishitemize}
    \item Take an Imperial Knight
    \item Take an Assassins detachment
    \item Take an additional formation
    \item Replace the base detachment with an Inquisition detachment
    \item Replace the base detachment with a Legion of the Damned detachment
    \end{squishitemize}
  \end{squishitemize}

\item All Troops in the players' base detachments have the Objective
  Secured rule, as defined on page~122 of the main rulebook.
  \emph{N.B.:} This does not include Troops purchased via an army
  upgrade, nor summoned units.

\item Unique units, wargear, and other elements may only be fielded by
  one player in a team.

\item Teammates together nominate a single warlord.  It must be a
  character if the army has a character.  Random warlord traits may be
  re-rolled.

\item The base detachments of both players must be of factions from
  the same allegiance:
  \begin{squishitemize}    
  \item {\bf Imperium:} Astra Militarum, Sororitas, Blood Angels, Dark
    Angels, Grey Knights, Legion of the Damned, Tempestus, Space
    Marines, Space Wolves, Inquisition
  \item {\bf Heretical:} Astra Militarum, Chaos Daemons, Chaos Space
    Marines, Inquisition
  \item {\bf Xenos:} Astra Militarum, Dark Eldar, Eldar, Necron, Ork,
    Tau, Tyranid, Inquisition
  \end{squishitemize}

\item Units from army upgrades need not have the same allegiance as
  the base detachment.

\item All the factions present within a team are considered Allies of
  Convenience at worst.
\end{itemize}

\missionheading{Doubles Gameplay}

In the psychic phase, a single D6 is rolled by the current team to
determine the base warp charge from which each of the four players
generates their own pool as usual.  The players all use their own warp
charge pool; teammates cannot combine or share warp charge.  Either
opposing player with models on the table may attempt to deny the
witch, caveat that if a specific unit of models belonging to just one
player is targeted, they alone may attempt to deny the spell.

For all other gameplay purposes the combined forces of a team are
considered a single army comprised of multiple detachments.  By the
army construction rules, all units in a team are at worst Allies of
Convenience.  Rules for how units belonging to different players in a
team may interact are thus governed by those of Battle Brothers and
Allies of Convenience on page~127 of the main rulebook.  In sum:

\begin{squishitemize}
\item {\bf Battle Brothers}
  \begin{squishitemize}
  \item Benefit from warlord traits;
  \item ICs may join units;
  \item Targetable by blessings \& special abilities;
  \item May embark transports.
  \end{squishitemize}

\item {\bf Allies of Convenience}
  \begin{squishitemize}
  \item Cannot move within 1'' of each other;
  \item Do not benefit from warlord traits;
  \item ICs may not join units;
  \item May not be targeted by blessings and special abilities;
  \item Are affected by maledictions and special abilities affecting
    ``enemy'' units.
  \end{squishitemize}
\end{squishitemize}

Being a single army also entails that teams are not eliminated unless
there are no models of either member on the table.  Units also may not
shoot at close combats even if their player is not engaged.


\missionheading{Restrictions}

Players will use a single army list for all missions.  All up to date
sources\footnote{Partial list maintained by Redcap's Corner and PAGE:
  \url{http://bit.ly/1uWkFHz}} are permitted.  No requirements or
constraints are placed on detachments or force organizations.  Forge
World units and armies eligible for standard \emph{Warhammer 40,000}
are permitted.

Models need not be painted, but objective painting scores will be
applied to reward finished armies.

Models must be WYSIWYG, but identifiable and thoughtful conversions
and proxies are welcome.  Contact the tournament organizer(s)
beforehand about any uncertain models.  Indistinguishable or confusing
proxies are not permitted.

\missionheading{Supporting Materials}

You must have an official, legal, complete physical or digital copy on
hand for all army, unit, and other sources you are using.  You should
bring printed copies of relevant pages of any electronic sources.
Don't forget errata and FAQs for your sources.\footnote{Available from
  Games Workshop:
  \url{http://www.games-workshop.com/Rules-Errata}}

You must bring any dice, templates, and markers you need to facilitate
playing your army, as well as five typed copies of your army roster
with points listed.

\missionheading{Scoring}%

Match results are determined by scoring primary, secondary, and
tertiary objectives as given for each mission.  The winner is the
player with more victory points at game end.  The players draw if they
have earned equal victory points.  No more than~20 victory points may
be earned per mission.

Pure competition standings, i.e., the Best General prize(s) if
awarded, are determined first by win/draw/loss records and then the
sum total victory points earned across all three missions.

Overall tournament rankings and the primary prize(s) are based on
points earned toward a maximum of~100 available for the day:
\begin{itemize}\shortlist
\item 60 points for match results
\item 25 points for painting and craftsmanship
\item 15 points for sportsmanship
\end{itemize}

Match results are a simple sum of the victory points earned in each
mission, up to 20 points each.

Painting and craftsmanship is scored objectively by the judge(s)
applying this rubric to the armies:

\begin{itemize}\shortlist
\item All models assembled and primed: +5 pts
\item All models three-color minimum: +5 pts
\item All models based (paint/flock): +5 pts
\item Advanced painting techniques present (washes, drybrushing, etc): +5 pts
\item Advanced basing techniques present: +5 pts
\end{itemize}

Sportsmanship scores include two components:
\begin{itemize}\shortlist
\item The sum of sportsmanship scores given after each mission (9 pts
  available).

\item Players ranking their opponents by most enjoyable to play (6 pts
  available).
\end{itemize}

Please make sure to submit sportsmanship scores as appropriate,
including the final ranking, as otherwise it impairs your opponents'
overall scores!
