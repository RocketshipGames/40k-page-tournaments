\begin{scoring}
  
\begin{primaries}
  At game end, each unit that has been eliminated, is falling back, is
  in reserve, or has at most~25\% of its starting models remaining is
  broken.  Earn~2 victory points per quartile if at least 25\%, 50\%,
  and 75\% of the opposing army by units is broken.  Earn~1 victory
  point per quartile if at least 25\%, 50\%, and 75\% of your army is
  not broken.  An additional victory point is earned by the team who
  has had a smaller percentage of the units in their army broken.  If
  one team has been completely eliminated, the opposing team gains an
  additional victory point.  \underline{No more than 9 victory points
    may be earned via this primary objective.}
