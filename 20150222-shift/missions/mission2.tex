\begin{primaries}
  At game end, control of the primary objective marker in your
  opponent's deployment zone is worth 3 victory points.  Control of
  the marker in your own deployment zone is worth 2 victory points.

  In addition, at game end, each unit that has been eliminated, is
  falling back, or has at most~25\% of its starting models remaining
  is broken.  Earn~1 victory point per quartile if at least 25\%,
  50\%, and 75\% of your opponent's army by units is broken.  An
  additional victory is earned by the player who has had a smaller
  percentage of the units in their army broken.
