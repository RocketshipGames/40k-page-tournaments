\begin{scoring}  
\begin{primaries}
  Before any Scout redeployments, both players secretly choose one of
  the following primary scoring mechanisms for themselves:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\textit{Continuous.}} Beginning with Turn~2, score~1 victory
    point at the end of each of your player turns for each primary
    objective marker you control.
  
  \item {\textit{End Game.}} At game end, score~3 victory points for
    each primary objective marker you control.  
  \end{itemize}

  This selection is declared along with the choice of secondary
  objective, below, after Scout redeployments.  Remember that
  \underline{no more than 9 victory points may be earned toward
    primary objectives}.
