  broken.  Earn~2 victory points per quartile if at least 25\%, 50\%,
  and 75\% of the opposing army by units is broken.  Earn~1 victory
  point per quartile if at least 25\%, 50\%, and 75\% of your army is
  not broken.  An additional victory point is earned by the player who
  has had a smaller percentage of the units in their army broken.  If
  one player has been completely eliminated, the opposing player gains
  an additional victory point.  \underline{No more than 9 victory
